it only can handle arrays that have nonnegative integer vallues and nothing else
however this restriction allows it to be much more effcient than more generic comparison-based soring algorithms.
the way it works is that first cont up howmany times each value appears in the array
then we use these counts to calculate how many values are less than or eqal to each particular element in the array
once you know how many values are less than or equal to an element you know what postion 
it needs to be placed in to be sorted, so you acn just put each element into its final.

pigenhole sort is an integer sorting algorithm thats similar to counting sort
in that both use the keys of an element index into an auxiliary array.
the difference is that while counting sort indexes into this array to keep track of the counts of each element
pigenhole sort actually copies over the element itself and appends it to a list that is contained 
within each index of auxiliary array 
in this way the aux array with pigenhole sort ends up containg all of the elements that correspond to particular index in 
the auxiliary array 
and this means that once you have everything copied over all you have to do is
concatenate all of these lists and then you will end up with the sorted
